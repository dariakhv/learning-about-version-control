# learning-about-version-control
“Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!”

Like: In verison control, I like the transperency and ease of access for information about changes, dates, and responsibilities, as well as the ability to access any dessired version at any point of the project.

Dislike: Version contol commands are challenging to grasp, and while the payout in the future will be great, the process is not the most straightforward.
